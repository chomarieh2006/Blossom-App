# Blossom
Team Members: Sneha Shekhar, Marie Cho, Aanya Singh
## Project goals and features:
- Our goal is to fuel productivity in our users and give them motivation to do their daily tasks.
- Our app features a plant that grows based on the number of tasks completed.
- The plant resets every day.
- Our app also tracks the user's history of tasks (completed and non-completed) so the user can track their progress.
- Our users can create tasks that they need to complete throughout the day.
- Possible implementation of pre-set tasks (that stay the same on all the days).
## Project Architecture:
- Four screens:
  - Home Page (Plant that grows)
  - To-Do List (Create task, mark it as complete)
  - Task History/ Calendar (tracks progress)
  - Zoom in on a day (Select a day on the task history calendar, and this screen displays the stats from that day!)
- We have a nav bar on each page for easy navigation.
